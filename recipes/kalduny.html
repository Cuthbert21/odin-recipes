        <p>Kolduny (kalduny) is a traditional dish of Belarusian cuisine. There are two varieties of kolduny: flour and potato.</p>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul class="non-main-list">
            <li>200g ground beef</li>
            <li>1 large white onion</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 large (or 6 medium) potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>4 heaping Tbsp plain flour</li>
            <li>1 beaten egg</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp soured cream and more for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel, wash and grate potatoes and 3/4 of the onion into a bowl (the onion will help you keep grated potatoes from turning brown). Use a grater with small holes. Add salt and mix until a smooth even consistency is obtained. Add the egg, flour, 1 Tbsp sour cream (optional), 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper and stir well.</li>
            <li>Grate the remaining 1/4 onion into a separate bowl and mix with the meat. For the meat into small patties.</li>
            <li>Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add 2 Tbsp oil. Once oil is hot, add 2 Tbsp of the mixture at a time into the skillet, flattening it out. Top with a thin meat patty and cover the meat with another 2 Tbsp of potato batter. Saute until potatoes are golden brown then flip and continue saut√©ing until golden brown and cooked through (about 4 min per side). Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil as needed. Remove to a paper-towel lined plate and serve warm with sour cream.</li>
        </ol>
